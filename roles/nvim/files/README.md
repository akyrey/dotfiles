## My Neovim configuration

Files in these directory are greatly inspired, and some of them even copied, from [LunarVim](https://github.com/LunarVim/LunarVim).  
I'm quite new to vim world and after using different users example configurations, I decided to start from LunarVim structure and
adapt it to what I wanted.
